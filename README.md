## Scale to TV

## Compatibility

Requires FVTT version 0.1.0 or higher

To install a module, follow these instructions:

1. Download the zip file
2. Extract the included folder to `public/modules` in your Foundry Virtual Tabletop installation folder.
3. Modify the tvSize/tvXRes/tvYRes variables in the tvScale.js file to match the dimensions and resolution of your TV.
4. Restart Foundry Virtual Tabletop. 

## How to Use the plugin

Once the plugin is loaded a new lock icon will appear below the main tool selection.

Provided there is a grid size set on the current scene this lock button will adjust the zoom level of the client to match a 1" square on the TV (atleast it should provided the variables mentioned above are adjusted).

## Notes and Mentions

This was a quickly thrown together module because I needed it for a session that I was running. I may update it later to make the code better.

### Big thanks to Atropos and Felix ( aka sly3r86 ) for their help and the code which was totally not butchered to make this.
